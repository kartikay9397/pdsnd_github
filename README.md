### Date created
The Bikeshare Project is created on 26 May 2020 and this README file on 6 June 2020

### Project Title
Exploratory Data Analysis of Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, **R Programming** is used to explore data related to bike share  
systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
We had to write the code to;
* Import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics
* Write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the working environment to present these statistics.

### Files used
The data files which have been used are : 
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv
