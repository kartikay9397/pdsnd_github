### Date created
The Bikeshare Project is created on 26 May 2020 and this README file on 6 June 2020

### Project Title
Exploratory Data Analysis of Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, **R Programming** is used to explore data related to bike share  
systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
We had to write the code to;
* Import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics
* Write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the working environment to present these statistics.

### Files used
The data files which have been used are : 
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv

#### Requirements
This program was written in R (Version 3.6.3) and RStudio (Version 1.2.5033) and also relies on the following libraries :
* ggplot2
* plyr
* dplyr

I am really thankful to [This Page](https://www.feedspot.com/infiniterss.php?_src=feed_title&followfeedid=4512210&q=site:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.r-bloggers.com%2Ffeed%2F) which has inspired me to take on this interesting project in 
R Programming and explore data analysis using amazing tools. 
In order to write and complete my documentation in this markdown file [This Link](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) really helped me a lot.
